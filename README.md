👋 Hi, I'm Shanmukha Kowshik Singaraju, a student currently focused on learning Deep Neural Networks 🧠. My interests lie in the fields of Data Science 📊, Natural Language Processing 🗣️, and OpenCV 🖼️. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems 💻 and am constantly working on personal projects to hone my skills 🛠️. Although I'm currently using GitHub primarily for personal projects, my long-term goal is to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the larger developer community 🤝. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to reach out to me at shanmukhkowshik@gmail.com 📧. Join me on my journey as I explore the possibilities of technology! 🚀
